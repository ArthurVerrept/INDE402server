# IOT-Server-Side
--- NO LONGER WORKING ---

Our task was to record data through an IOT and display it online on a heroku hosted website, and store data in a mongoDB database using NodeJS.

The project showed sound over time and it showed data over 20 minute intervals.

The code for the IOT can be found on the other IOT repo.
